# EPOCH Task 2

## Description
This project is made for a task for EPOCH (the AI/ML) club, IITH selection. It involves CNN model trained on handwritten alphabet images and an RNN+LSTM model trained on sentences for sentimental analysis. Further, the two models are combined to predict the sentiment of text in an image of particular dimensions.
<br> The resources are provided, except for the handwritten alphabet images dataset. Follow this, for the datasets used: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oG96SkGUUQnNmI_PIiiJl7vipAM9s8P8 .
